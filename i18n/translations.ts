    // --- MODULE: BANKING ---
    module_banking_title: 'Banking Basics',
    module_banking_desc: 'Learn how to open and manage a bank account.',
    module_banking_content_1: '### Welcome to Banking!\nHaving a bank account is one of the first and most important steps to managing your finances in a new country. It provides a safe place to keep your money, makes it easier to get paid by an employer, and allows you to pay bills efficiently without carrying large amounts of cash.',
    module_banking_content_2: '### Checking vs. Savings Accounts\nThere are two main types of bank accounts you should know about:\n- **Checking Accounts:** These are transactional accounts designed for everyday use. You can use a debit card, write checks, and set up automatic bill payments. Money flows in and out frequently.\n- **Savings Accounts:** These are designed for storing money you don\'t need immediately. They often earn interest, meaning the bank pays you a small percentage for keeping your money there. They usually have limits on how many times you can withdraw money per month.',
    module_banking_content_3: '### How to Open an Account\nTo open an account, you will generally need to visit a branch or apply online. You will need:\n1.  **Identification:** A passport, driver\'s license, or government ID.\n2.  **Proof of Address:** A utility bill (electric/water) or rental agreement in your name.\n3.  **Social Security Number (SSN) or Tax ID:** If you don\'t have one, ask for accounts that accept an ITIN or foreign passport.\n4.  **Initial Deposit:** A small amount of cash (e.g., $25) to activate the account.',
    module_banking_content_4: '### Understanding Fees\nBanks may charge fees, but many can be avoided:\n-   **Monthly Maintenance Fee:** A fee for having the account. It is often waived if you set up direct deposit or keep a minimum balance.\n-   **Overdraft Fee:** Charged if you spend more money than you have. This can be $35 or more per transaction!\n-   **ATM Fee:** Charged for using a machine that doesn\'t belong to your bank.\n\n*Tip: always ask for a "fee schedule" when you open your account.*',
    module_banking_content_5: '### Using a Debit Card\nA debit card allows you to spend money directly from your checking account. It looks like a credit card but uses your own money. You will set a **PIN** (Personal Identification Number) for security. Never share your PIN with anyone, not even bank employees.',
    module_banking_content_6: '### Writing Checks\nAlthough less common now, checks are still used for rent or official payments. A check tells the bank to pay a specific person or company from your account. Always ensure you have enough money in your account before writing a check to avoid "bouncing" it, which incurs fees.',
    module_banking_content_7: '### Mobile & Online Banking\nAlmost all banks now offer mobile apps. These are powerful tools that allow you to:\n- Check your balance instantly.\n- Deposit checks by taking a photo of them.\n- Transfer money to friends or pay bills.\n- Freeze your debit card instantly if you lose it.\n\nSetting up the app is highly recommended for security and convenience.',
    module_banking_content_8: '### What is ChexSystems?\nChexSystems is a reporting agency that tracks your banking history. If you have abandoned an account with a negative balance in the past, you might be reported to ChexSystems, making it hard to open a new account for 5 years. If this happens, ask for a "Second Chance" checking account.',

    sim_banking_step1_feedback1: 'Not quite! Since you don\'t have an account yet, you cannot withdraw money. You need to open an account first.',

    sim_banking_step2_content: 'The banker introduces themselves and asks what kind of account you need.',

    sim_banking_step2_opt2: 'I need an account to pay bills and receive my salary.',
    sim_banking_step2_feedback1: 'A savings account is a good goal, but for your daily needs like bills and salary, a Checking Account is usually the best first step.',
    sim_banking_step2_feedback2: 'Excellent choice! A checking account is the best tool for daily financial management like paying bills and getting paid.',

    sim_banking_step3_feedback1: 'That is exactly what they need! Official government ID and proof of where you live are standard requirements.',
    sim_banking_step3_feedback2: 'A library card is not an official government ID. You will need a Passport, Driver\'s License, or similar official document.',

    sim_banking_step4_title: 'Initial Deposit',
    sim_banking_step4_content: 'To activate the account, the banker asks for a small deposit.',
    sim_banking_step4_opt1: 'I have $25 in cash to deposit.',
    sim_banking_step4_opt2: 'Can I borrow money from you to open it?',
    sim_banking_step4_feedback1: 'Great! Most banks require a small initial deposit (often $25-$100) to get the account started.',
    sim_banking_step4_feedback2: 'Banks generally don\'t lend money for the initial deposit. You need your own funds to open a checking account.',

    sim_banking_step5_title: 'Debit Card Setup',
    sim_banking_step5_content: 'Your account is open! Now you need to set a PIN for your debit card.',
    sim_banking_step5_opt1: 'I will write the PIN on the card so I don\'t forget.',
    sim_banking_step5_opt2: 'I will memorize the PIN and never share it.',
    sim_banking_step5_feedback1: 'Oh no! Never write your PIN on the card. If you lose it, anyone can access your money. Always keep it secret.',
    sim_banking_step5_feedback2: 'Smart move! Memorizing your PIN is the safest way to protect your money from theft.',

    sim_banking_step6_title: 'Understanding Fees',
    sim_banking_step6_content: 'The banker hands you a fee schedule. What should you look for?',
    sim_banking_step6_opt1: 'I will check for monthly maintenance and overdraft fees.',
    sim_banking_step6_opt2: 'I don\'t need to read this; fees don\'t matter.',
    sim_banking_step6_feedback1: 'Excellent habit! Knowing how to avoid monthly fees (like by having direct deposit) keeps more money in your pocket.',
    sim_banking_step6_feedback2: 'Be careful! Ignoring fees can lead to unexpected charges that eat away at your balance.',

    sim_banking_step7_title: 'Online Banking',
    sim_banking_step7_content: 'The banker asks if you want to set up the mobile app.',
    sim_banking_step7_opt1: 'Yes, please help me set it up.',
    sim_banking_step7_opt2: 'No, I will just come to the branch every time.',
    sim_banking_step7_feedback1: 'Great idea! The mobile app lets you check your balance and pay bills 24/7, saving you time.',
    sim_banking_step7_feedback2: 'You can do that, but setting up the app gives you freedom to manage your money from anywhere, anytime.',

    sim_banking_step9_opt1: 'I\'ll sign a blank check and let the landlord fill it out.',
    sim_banking_step9_opt2: 'I\'ll write the landlord\'s name, the amount, and sign it.',
    sim_banking_step9_feedback1: 'Never do this! A blank signed check allows anyone to take all your money. Always fill it out completely.',
    sim_banking_step9_feedback2: 'Correct! Always fill in the Payee (who gets the money) and the exact Amount to ensure it goes to the right place.',

    module_budgeting_desc: 'Master the art of tracking income and expenses.',
    module_budgeting_content_1: '### Why Budget?\nA budget is not about restricting your freedom; it is about creating it. A budget helps you control your money instead of your money controlling you. It creates a roadmap for your finances, allowing you to prioritize what matters most, save for future goals, and avoid high-interest debt.',
    module_budgeting_content_2: '### The 50/30/20 Rule\nA simple and effective way to budget is the 50/30/20 rule:\n- **50% Needs:** Rent, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments. These are bills you *must* pay to survive.\n- **30% Wants:** Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, streaming subscriptions. These are things you *enjoy* but can live without.\n- **20% Savings:** Retirement contributions, emergency fund, and extra debt payments. This is how you build wealth.',
    module_budgeting_content_3: '### Tracking Expenses\nTo build a budget, you must first know where your money goes. Use an app, a spreadsheet, or a simple notebook to track every purchase for a month. You might be surprised by how much small expenses like coffee or snacks add up over 30 days. Awareness is the first step to change.',
    module_budgeting_content_4: '### Emergency Fund\nAn emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected costs, like a car repair, medical bill, or job loss. Aim to save **$1,000** as quickly as possible. Once you have that, work towards saving **3-6 months** of living expenses. This fund prevents you from going into debt when life happens.',
    module_budgeting_content_5: '### Zero-Based Budgeting\nThis is a strategy where you give every dollar a job. If you earn $3,000, you assign every single dollar to a category (spending or saving) until you have $0 left to allocate. This ensures no money is "lost" or spent mindlessly.',
    module_budgeting_content_6: '### The Envelope System\nIf you struggle with overspending on things like groceries or dining out, try using cash envelopes. Withdraw the exact amount of cash you budgeted for that category (e.g., $400 for groceries) and put it in an envelope. When the envelope is empty, you cannot spend any more on that category until next month.',
    module_budgeting_content_7: '### Setting SMART Goals\nFinancial goals should be **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Instead of saying "I want to save money," say "I will save $5,000 for a car down payment by saving $200 every month for 25 months."',
    module_budgeting_content_8: '### Dealing with Irregular Income\nIf you work gig jobs or have variable hours, budgeting is harder but even more important. Calculate your "baseline" expenses (the minimum you need to survive). On high-income months, save the extra money to cover the low-income months. Always budget based on your lowest expected income, not your highest.',
    module_budgeting_content_9: '### Cutting Costs\nIf your expenses exceed your income, you must cut costs. Look at:\n- **Subscriptions:** Cancel unused streaming services.\n- **Food:** Cook at home and bring lunch to work.\n- **Energy:** Turn off lights and lower heating/cooling when not home.\n- **Shopping:** Wait 24 hours before making any non-essential purchase to avoid impulse buying.',
    module_budgeting_content_10: '### Automating Savings\nThe easiest way to save is to make it automatic. Set up a recurring transfer from your checking account to your savings account on payday. If you don\'t see the money, you won\'t spend it.',

    module_credit_title: 'Credit Scores & Loans',
    module_credit_desc: 'Understand how credit works and how to build it.',
    module_credit_content_1: '### What is Credit?\nCredit is borrowed money that you pay back later, usually with interest. It is built on trust. When you use a credit card or take a loan, you are promising to repay the money. How well you keep that promise becomes your "credit history."',
    module_credit_content_2: '### The Credit Score\nIn many countries like the US, Canada, and UK, lenders look at a 3-digit number (usually 300-850) called a credit score. \n- **300-579:** Poor\n- **580-669:** Fair\n- **670-739:** Good\n- **740-799:** Very Good\n- **800+:** Excellent\nA higher score means you are trustworthy, which helps you get loans with lower interest rates, rent better apartments, and even get cell phone plans without deposits.',
    module_credit_content_3: '### Factors That Affect Your Score\nYour score is calculated based on:\n1. **Payment History (35%):** Do you pay on time? Late payments hurt the most.\n2. **Amounts Owed (30%):** Using too much of your available credit (e.g., spending $900 on a $1000 limit) lowers your score. Keep usage below 30%.\n3. **Length of History (15%):** Longer history is better. Keep old cards open.\n4. **Credit Mix (10%):** Having different types (cards, car loans) is good.\n5. **New Credit (10%):** Applying for too many cards at once hurts your score.',
    module_credit_content_4: '### Building Credit from Scratch\nIf you are new to the country, you likely have no credit score (which is different from a bad score). To start:\n- **Secured Credit Card:** You deposit cash (e.g., $200) which becomes your credit limit. It works like a normal credit card and builds history.\n- **Credit Builder Loan:** A small loan held in a savings account. You make payments to "unlock" the money later.',
    module_credit_content_5: '### Reading Your Credit Report\nYou have a "Credit Report" that lists your history. You are entitled to a free copy every year from the major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). Review it carefully! Check for accounts you didn\'t open or payments marked late that were actually on time.',
    module_credit_content_6: '### Disputing Errors\nIf you find a mistake on your credit report, you can file a "dispute" with the credit bureau for free. They must investigate and remove incorrect information. This is a powerful way to protect your score.',
    module_credit_content_7: '### Hard vs. Soft Inquiries\n- **Soft Inquiry:** Checking your own score. Does NOT affect your credit.\n- **Hard Inquiry:** When a lender checks your credit to approve a loan. This lowers your score by a few points temporarily. Avoid too many hard inquiries in a short time.',
    module_credit_content_8: '### Interest Rates (APR)\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the cost of borrowing money. If you have a credit card with 20% APR and you carry a balance, you will owe significantly more money over time. **Always pay your full balance every month to avoid paying any interest.**',
    module_credit_content_9: '### Co-signing Risks\nNever co-sign a loan for a friend unless you are willing to pay the full debt yourself. If they miss a payment, it appears on *your* credit report and ruins *your* score. You are legally 100% responsible for the debt.',
    module_credit_content_10: '### Patience is Key\nBuilding excellent credit takes time. There are no shortcuts. A consistent history of on-time payments over years is the only way to get an 800+ score. Don\'t trust anyone selling "quick credit repair" schemes.',

    module_currency_content_1: '### Exchange Rates Basics\nAn exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another (e.g., 1 USD = 0.93 EUR). Rates change constantly based on global economics. \n- **Mid-Market Rate:** This is the "real" rate banks use to trade with each other. \n- **Retail Rate:** This is the rate *you* get, which usually includes a markup so the provider makes a profit.',
    module_currency_content_2: '### What are Remittances?\nRemittances are funds sent by a foreign worker to an individual in their home country. They are a vital lifeline for many families. However, losing money to fees means less money for your loved ones.',
    module_currency_content_3: '### The Cost of Sending Money\nServices make money in two ways:\n1. **Upfront Fee:** A flat charge (e.g., $5).\n2. **Exchange Rate Markup:** They offer you a worse rate than the mid-market rate (e.g., giving you 0.90 EUR instead of 0.93 EUR). The difference is hidden profit.\n**Always compare the "Total Amount Received"** by your family, not just the upfront fee.',
    module_currency_content_4: '### Transfer Methods\n- **Bank Wires:** Secure and good for very large amounts, but often slow and expensive ($25-$45 fees).\n- **Money Transfer Operators:** Companies like Western Union or MoneyGram. Good for sending cash for pickup, but fees can vary widely.\n- **Digital Transfer Services:** Apps like Wise, Remitly, or WorldRemit. Often have lower fees and better rates because they have lower overhead costs.',
    module_currency_content_5: '### Transfer Speed vs. Cost\nSpeed costs money. "Instant" transfers usually have higher fees or worse exchange rates. If your family can wait 2-3 days, economy options are almost always cheaper. Plan ahead to save money.',
    module_currency_content_6: '### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Risks\nAvoid sending money to strangers using apps like Zelle, Venmo, or CashApp for goods you haven\'t received. These transfers operate like cash; once sent, they are usually impossible to reverse if you are scammed.',
    module_currency_content_7: '### Hidden Fees\nWatch out for "Zero Fee" advertisements. If a company claims zero commission, they are almost certainly hiding a large fee in the exchange rate. Always do the math.',
    module_currency_content_8: '### Consumer Rights\nIn the U.S., the CFPB "Remittance Rule" gives you rights. Providers generally must disclose:\n- The exact exchange rate.\n- Fees charged.\n- The amount your recipient will receive.\n- The date the money will be available.\nIf the receipt is wrong, you have a right to cancel within 30 minutes for a full refund.',
    module_currency_content_9: '### Aggregator Sites\nUse comparison websites (like Monito) to compare rates from different providers in real-time. This can save you significant amounts of money over a year.',
    module_currency_content_10: '### Large Transfers\nIf you need to send a large amount (e.g., $10,000+), you may need to provide additional documentation to prove the source of funds due to anti-money laundering laws.

    // --- MODULE: TAXES ---
    module_taxes_title: 'Taxes Explained',
    module_taxes_desc: 'Navigate the tax system and filing requirements.',
    module_taxes_content_1: '### Income Tax Basics\nThe government collects a percentage of your earnings to pay for public services like roads, schools, and military. This is called Income Tax. \n- **Federal Tax:** Goes to the national government.\n- **State Tax:** Goes to your specific state (not all states have this).\n- **Local Tax:** Goes to your city or county.',
    module_taxes_content_2: '### Withholding (W-4 Form)\nWhen you start a job, you fill out a W-4 form. This tells your employer how much tax to take out of every paycheck automatically ("withholding"). If they take out too much, you get a refund later. If they take out too little, you owe money at the end of the year.',
    module_taxes_content_3: '### Filing a Tax Return\nEvery year (usually by April 15th in the US), you must report your total income to the tax agency (IRS) by filing a "Tax Return." You will receive forms like:\n- **W-2:** From your employer, showing total wages and taxes paid.\n- **1099:** If you are a freelancer or gig worker (like Uber/DoorDash).',
    module_taxes_content_4: '### Tax Brackets\nTaxes are "progressive." This means high earners pay a higher percentage than low earners. \n*Example:* You might pay 10% on your first $11,000, and 12% on the income above that. You don\'t pay 12% on *everything* just because you earned a dollar more.',
    module_taxes_content_5: '### Standard Deduction\nThe government allows you to earn a certain amount of money tax-free to cover basic living expenses. This is called the Standard Deduction. For single filers in 2024, it is $14,600. If you earn less than this, you generally don\'t owe federal income tax.',
    module_taxes_content_6: '### Tax Credits vs. Deductions\n- **Deduction:** Lowers the amount of income you are taxed on.\n- **Credit:** Lowers your tax bill directly, dollar-for-dollar. \nCredits like the **Child Tax Credit** or **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** are very powerful and can increase your refund significantly.',
    module_taxes_content_7: '### Filing Status\nYour status affects your tax rate. \n- **Single:** Unmarried.\n- **Married Filing Jointly:** Usually provides the best tax breaks for couples.\n- **Head of Household:** Unmarried but paying more than half the cost of a home for a dependent (like a child). This has better rates than "Single".',
    module_taxes_content_8: '### Deadlines and Penalties\nThe deadline is usually April 15. If you cannot file by then, you can request an **Extension** to file in October, but you **must pay any estimated taxes owed by April 15** to avoid interest and penalties. The penalty for not filing is much higher than the penalty for not paying.',
    module_taxes_content_9: '### Free Filing Options\nMany immigrants and low-to-moderate income earners can file for free. \n- **VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance):** Free in-person help for people earning under $64,000.\n- **IRS Free File:** Free software available online for qualifying incomes.',
    module_taxes_content_10: '### Refunds\nIf you paid more taxes during the year than you actually owed, the government sends you a check or direct deposit for the difference. This is a "Tax Refund." It feels like a bonus, but it is actually just your own money coming back to you.',

    sim_taxes_step8_opt1: 'It lowers your taxable income.',

    module_protection_content_1: '### Identity Theft\nIdentity theft happens when someone steals your personal information (like SSN, name, or credit card number) to commit fraud. They might open loans, file taxes, or get medical services in your name. If this happens, you are often not liable for the debt, but it is a huge hassle to fix.',
    module_protection_content_2: '### Phishing\nPhishing is when scammers pretend to be a trusted company (like your bank, Amazon, or Netflix) via email. They use scary language like "Your account is locked!" to trick you into clicking a link and entering your password. \n*Always check the sender\'s email address carefully.*',
    module_protection_content_3: '### Vishing and Smishing\n- **Vishing:** Voice phishing. Scammers call pretending to be the IRS or police, threatening arrest if you don\'t pay immediately.\n- **Smishing:** SMS phishing. Text messages saying a package delivery failed and you need to click a link to reschedule.',
    module_protection_content_4: '### Romance Scams\nScammers create fake profiles on dating apps or social media. They build a relationship with you over weeks, then suddenly have an "emergency" (medical bill, travel visa) and ask for money. Never send money to someone you haven\'t met in person.',
    module_protection_content_5: '### Tech Support Scams\nA popup appears on your computer saying "VIRUS DETECTED! Call this number." If you call, they claim to be Microsoft or Apple and ask for remote access to your computer. Once in, they can steal your passwords or install malware. Real tech companies never contact you this way.',
    module_protection_content_6: '### Employment Scams\nYou are offered a "work from home" job. They send you a check to buy "supplies" (laptop, software) and ask you to wire the extra money back to them. The check is fake. It will bounce days later, and the money you wired is gone from your own pocket.',
    module_protection_content_7: '### Password Security\n- Use long, complex passwords (phrases are good: "BlueElephantsDanceInRain!").\n- Never reuse passwords across sites.\n- Use a **Password Manager** (like Bitwarden or LastPass) to generate and store them secure.',
    module_protection_content_8: '### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\nEnable 2FA on every account (Email, Banking, Social Media). This requires a code sent to your phone or an authenticator app to log in, adding a second lock to your digital door.',
    module_protection_content_9: '### Freezing Your Credit\nThe best way to prevent new account fraud is to **Freeze Your Credit** with the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). It is free. When frozen, no one (including you) can open a new credit account in your name. You can unfreeze it temporarily when you need to apply for something.',
    module_protection_content_10: '### What to Do If Scammed\n1. **Contact your bank** immediately to reverse charges or freeze accounts.\n2. **Change passwords** for affected accounts.\n3. **Report it** to the relevant authority (e.g., FTC in the US at IdentityTheft.gov).\n4. **Place a fraud alert** on your credit report.',
